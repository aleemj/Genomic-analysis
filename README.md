# Genomic-analysis
Code for various genomic analysis (including population genomics, GWAS and GS) 

The for sequence alignment can be found at https://github.com/aleemj/WGS-alignment-variant-calling.git

Codes for the following steps (and their plotting where necessary) are recorded:

Please edit all file names and codes as necessary, these codes provide only a guideline as to how to run the following analysis.

a. Renaming genotype files
1. Change chromosome names
2. Change sample naames

b. Reformating genotype files
1. vcf to bed
2. bed to ped
3. ped to bed

c. Filtering genotype files
1. Samples
2. SNPs (To be updated)
3. Chromosomes (To be updated)

d. LD Pruning

e. Population genomics (clustering)
1. Admixture
2. PCA
3. Phylogenetic

f. Genetic diversity statistics 
1. Nucleotide diversity
2. Tajima D
3. Fst
4. LD decay

g. Genome wide association studies

h. Genomic selection
